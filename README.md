# HelloWorld
This is my First Git Hub Repository

I can't decide if this is the first of many and if code management is right for me or not. See I'm really just a task automation script developer so it's hard to say whether I'm adding a layer of complexity to my work flow, or adopting best practices that will save me trouble down the line. Only time will tell I suppose!
